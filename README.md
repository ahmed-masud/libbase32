# libbase32

A C implementation of Douglas Crockford's base32 encoding.
The Crockford scheme is designed to be able to achieve the following:


  - Be human readable and machine readable.
  - Be compact. Humans have difficulty in manipulating long strings of arbitrary symbols.
  - Be error resistant. Entering the symbols must not require keyboarding gymnastics.
  - Be pronounceable. Humans should be able to accurately transmit the symbols to other humans using a telephone.
